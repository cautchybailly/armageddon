Bedrock-powered “auto-IR” pipeline for advanced students who can actually build and demo.

The pattern below is what real orgs do: alarm → evidence collection → LLM summarization → report artifact → notify.
This will be given to you

1) Incident report template (structured, consistent, gradeable)
2) Integration framework (AWS architecture + flow)
3) Terraform skeleton resources (Chewbacca naming)
4) Lambda handler skeleton (Python) that:
    pulls alarm context
    runs CloudWatch Logs Insights queries (WAF + app)
    pulls known-good values from SSM + Secrets
    calls Bedrock Runtime InvokeModel 
    writes report to S3
    notifies via SNS
Prompt pack (so reports are high signal, not vibes)

1) Auto-generated Incident Report Template (Markdown)
You must output exact headings (easy to implement).
